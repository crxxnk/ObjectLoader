# OBJ Loader

A lightweight, modern C++ OBJ file loader library designed for flexibility, performance, and ease of integration. Built with C++20 features, templates, and modern best practices in mind.

## Features

- Load `.obj` files with vertices, normals, and texture coordinates.
- Supports multiple objects and materials.
- Designed for integration in graphics engines, game projects, or 3D tools.
- Extensible with custom loaders, parsers, or post-processing steps.
- Minimal dependencies (header-only optional).

## !NOTE!

- This project is in its early stages. I strongly discourage using it in production or real-world applications at this time.

## Requirements

- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
